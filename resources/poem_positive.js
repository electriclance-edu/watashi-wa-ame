    "i am the rain.",
    "i rise from the sea",
    "as i have always done",
    "and hiding the stars,",
    "i sing from the sky in white and grey",

    "nobody hears, of course",
    "and for a time i will be fine with that",
    "there's much to see, after all",
    "but the weight of my water-self grows too heavy",
    "and i fall",

    "you have to understand, it's cold up there",
    "closer to the light, yes, but farther from you",
    "oh, i dont mean just you",
    "sorry if it came that way",
    "i mean you all",

    "so i fall down, guided by the wind",
    "inhaling the breadth of the sky",
    "i hit the ground, i hit the trees",
    "i hit your hand, and it irritates you",
    "and i think, oh, how differently warm you are",

    "i soak you, the lonely head who forgot her umbrella",
    "i am sorry, really",
    "im glad you're here to protect her, now",
    "the sun, was what you called her?",
    "i wish i could have heard her name from her mouth.",

    "i fall down",
    "and when i look back, i see the stars",
    "and i am blown to lands you will never see",
    "and i am part of magic you will never know",
    "lands and magics i have known for a billion years",

    "i will fall a billion years more",
    "as is who i am",
    "i will touch the warmth",
    "and steal from it",
    "as is who i am",

    "but thank you, for this moment",
    "where you repel me",
    "and i need not feel the sensation",
    "of warmth stolen from another",
    "protect her, from me.",
